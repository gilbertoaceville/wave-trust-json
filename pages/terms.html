                    Thank you for choosing WaveTrust. The following Terms and Conditions and the Privacy policy
                    (together,
                    the “Terms”) apply to any person that registers for and/or opens a WaveTrust Account through
                    WaveTrust.com or
                    any associated mobile applications, website, or APIs (together, the “WaveTrust Site”).

                    The Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and WaveTrust Ltd., which is a
                    company
                    incorporated under the laws of Albany, New York. For further information on WaveTrust Ltd., and
                    its
                    operating subsidiaries, please see the Company Information page on the WaveTrust website. For the
                    purposes of these Terms, any reference to “we” “us” “our” “WaveTrust” and/or any similar term shall
                    be
                    construed as reference to WaveTrust Ltd.

                    By registering for and opening a WaveTrust Account, you unconditionally accept these Terms and agree
                    to
                    be bound by and act in accordance with them. You also accept and agree that you are solely
                    responsible for understanding and complying with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of

                    foreign currency transactions. Depending on your country of residence, you may not be able to use
                    all the functions of the WaveTrust Site.

                    Please read these Terms carefully before using the WaveTrust Site because they affect your legal
                    rights
                    and obligations.
                    WaveTrust may amend the Terms from time to time. You should visit the WaveTrust website regularly to

                    of any amendments to the Terms that we consider likely to materially affect your rights and
                    obligations. Any such notice will be posted on the WaveTrust Site, or sent by email to the address
                    associated with your WaveTrust Account.

                    The continued use of your WaveTrust Account, after any amendment to these Terms, constitutes your
                    acceptance of the Terms, as modified by such amendment. If you do not accept the Terms, or any
                    amendment to them, you must immediately stop using the WaveTrust Site and your WaveTrust Account.

                    other representatives. This agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be

                    WaveTrust implements and maintains the highest standards of Know Your Customer (“KYC”) processes and
                    controls as part of our commitment to combating fraud and assisting in the prevention of money
                    laundering and terrorist financing. While our industry is largely unregulated, WaveTrust voluntarily
                    adheres to local and international compliance standards in relation to customer due diligence, as
                    explained on the Compliance page of the WaveTrust website.

                    To ensure we meet these standards, our customers are required to provide certain personal details
                    and documents when opening a WaveTrust Account (“Identity Verification”). The nature and extent of
                    the
                    Identity Verification required will depend upon which of our supported countries you are resident
                    in, and the deposit and withdrawal limits that you wish to apply to your WaveTrust Account. In
                    certain
                    circumstances, WaveTrust may also perform enhanced due diligence (“EDD”) procedures in relation to
                    your
                    WaveTrust Account. You accept and agree that you will remain subject to such procedures at all
                    times.
                    WaveTrust reserves the right to, at any time restrict or suspend your WaveTrust Account when we, in
                    our sole
                    discretion, consider it necessary to carry out further Identity Verification and/or EDD, or
                    terminate your WaveTrust Account if you provide, or we suspect you have provided, false information
                    or
                    refuse to provide information we require for Identity Verification and/or EDD.
                    You accept and agree that there may be delays in accessing your WaveTrust Account, or in carrying
                    out
                    transactions through your WaveTrust Account, while we undertake any Identity Verification and/or EDD
                    procedures.
                    WaveTrust is required to retain certain information and documentation obtained as part of the
                    Identity
                    Verification and EDD procedures. These requirements apply even when you have terminated your
                    relationship with WaveTrust. We reserve the right to keep such information and documentation for the
                    required period and you accept and agree that information and documentation you provide to WaveTrust
                    may
                    be retained by us, including following the closure of your WaveTrust Account
                    By signing up to WaveTrust, you give us a nonexclusive
                    license to publish your documents on WaveTrust Services for verification with our underwriting team,
                    including anything
                    reasonably related to verifying it with government agencies.
                    It is the sole responsibility of the client to check the accuracy of information submitted to this
                    website, especially the registration details, documents provided for verification and bank account
                    for returns on investments. In the case that this information is incorrect, and funds are
                    transferred to an unintended destination, the company shall not reimburse the client and shall not
                    transfer additional funds. As such clients must ensure the all informations they submit are
                    completely correct, all transactions are made on your dashboard or account, and are not carried out
                    by <b>third-parties</b>. You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and risk
                    tolerance is suitable.
                    Where your identity has been verified (in accordance with the Identity Verification requirements),
                    you may deposit Local Currency into your WaveTrust account by depositing funds into a WaveTrust bank
                    account
                    (a “Deposit”). The WaveTrust bank account into which you make a Deposit will be a segregated account
                    used
                    exclusively for the purpose of holding and processing customer funds. Subject to these Terms, you
                    retain a right to any funds you deposit into the WaveTrust bank account until such time as your
                    funds are
                    used or withdrawn.

                    Details of the WaveTrust bank account into which you must make the Deposit will be provided to you
                    by
                    WaveTrust, and any such bank account will be held and operated by a WaveTrust operating entity in
                    your country
                    or region (for more information on these entities, see the Company Information page on the WaveTrust
                    website). You accept and agree that any information you provide to WaveTrust may be shared with such
                    local entity, which will process Local Currency transactions in accordance with WaveTrust’s
                    instructions.

                    The payment methods by which you may Deposit Local Currency will depend upon the country you are in,
                    and are set out on the Pricing page of the WaveTrust website (for the purposes of these Terms, the
                    “Supported Deposit Methods”). Where you have made a Deposit using a Supported Deposit Method, and
                    have adhered to the Deposit Requirements (explained below), your Deposit will be allocated to your
                    WaveTrust account.

                    Due to legal and operational constraints, you must strictly adhere to the following Deposit
                    requirements (the “Deposit Requirements”), you may only make a Deposit from a Supported Deposit
                    Method held in your own name. You must not allow any third party to make a Deposit into your
                    WaveTrust
                    account, you may only Deposit Local Currency using a Supported Deposit Method compatible with the
                    deposit methods available in your country or region, where you make a Deposit using a credit or
                    debit card, you authorise WaveTrust to facilitate the debiting of the funds from your bank account
                    in
                    order to complete the Deposit, you must not use cash or cheques to make a Deposit. WaveTrust
                    reserves the
                    right to refuse any Deposit made by cash or cheque. Should WaveTrust decide, in its sole discretion,
                    to
                    allow a Deposit by cash or cheque on an exceptional basis, the allocation of such Deposit will be
                    delayed to allow fraud and compliance checks to take place, and a Cash Deposit Penalty may be
                    deducted from it. Any WaveTrust Account that receives more than one cash or cheque deposit may, at
                    WaveTrust’s
                    sole discretion, be suspended indefinitely.
                    You agree to abide by the Deposit Requirements and agree and accept that failure to do so may cause
                    delay in or failure of any Deposit reflecting in your WaveTrust account, and/or restriction,
                    suspension
                    or termination of your WaveTrust Account.
                    When you request to make a Deposit through your WaveTrust account, you will be provided with a
                    Reference
                    Number or Unique Deposit Amount. To permit timely and successful allocation of a Deposit to your
                    WaveTrust account, you must use the Reference Number or Unique Deposit Amount when you make a
                    deposit
                    using a Supported Deposit Method. WaveTrust will not be responsible for any delay in or
                    non-allocation of
                    Deposits to your WaveTrust account where you fail to specify the required Reference Number or Unique
                    Deposit Amount.

                    Deposits may take time to reflect in your WaveTrust account due to bank processing times,
                    operational
                    processes, and/or failure by you to adhere to the Deposit Requirements. Under no circumstances will
                    WaveTrust have any liability to you in relation to any delay in or failure of a Deposit reflecting
                    in
                    your WaveTrust account.

                    WaveTrust will make all reasonable efforts to allocate Deposits that do not meet the Deposit
                    Requirements. However, any Deposits less than the Minimum Unallocated Deposit Amount that cannot be
                    allocated within a one month period will be retained by WaveTrust and you accept and agree that you
                    shall
                    have no further claim or entitlement to such funds. The Minimum Unallocated Deposit Amount shall
                    until otherwise determined by WaveTrust be USD49.99 or the equivalent in your Local Currency.
                    Where you have added your bank account details to your WaveTrust Account, you may withdraw funds
                    from
                    your WaveTrust account to your bank account (a “Withdrawal”). WaveTrust will process Withdrawals in
                    accordance
                    with your instructions. You are solely responsible for ensuring that any Withdrawal instructions
                    provided to WaveTrust, including the relevant bank account number, are complete and correct and you
                    accept and agree that under no circumstances will WaveTrust be under any obligation to reverse or
                    amend
                    any Withdrawal.

                    WaveTrust will make all reasonable efforts to process Withdrawals each business day, in accordance
                    with
                    the Deposit and Withdrawal Schedule on the WaveTrust website, but you accept and agree that
                    WaveTrust provides
                    no guarantee in relation to the Withdrawal processing period. Withdrawals to the bank account of any
                    third party are expressly prohibited. You agree not to make, or attempt to make, any Withdrawal of
                    funds from your WaveTrust account to the bank account of a third party and accept that any such
                    Withdrawal may be refused and/or result in the restriction, suspension or termination of your
                    WaveTrust
                    Account.

                    merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose.

                    Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied terms in consumer contracts, so some or
                    all of the disclaimers in this section may not apply to you. In no event shall WaveTrust, its
                    operating

                    damages
                    caused by or resulting from any reliance upon any information received from WaveTrust, or that
                    result
                    from mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletion of files or email, errors, defects, viruses,
                    delays in operation or transmission or any failure of performance, whether or not resulting from a
                    force majeure event, communications failure, theft, destruction or unauthorised access to
                    WaveTrust’s

                    applicable jurisdiction. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties
                    or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, some of the
                    limitations in this section may not apply to you.
